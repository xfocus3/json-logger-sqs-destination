# JSON Logger - Mule 4

Drop-in replacement for default Mule Logger that outputs a JSON structure based on a predefined JSON schema.

## Why?

- Logs are as good as the logging practices applied by developers
- Not all developers think alike on what needs to be logged
- No tools to enforce proper logging standards
- Simple but essential logging best practices (e.g. tie multiple log entries to a single transaction by using a correlation id) are inconsistent and drastically impact troubleshooting capabilities
- The rise of Splunk, ELK and other log aggregation platforms is due to their ability to aggregate, understand and exploit data
- These platforms typically understand key=value pairs or JSON data structures. Only then, the full potential of these tools can be unlocked in the form of advanced dashboards and reports

For these reasons and based on previous customer experiences, I created this generic Java SDK JSON Logger Connector.

## How?

As mentioned above, this is a Java SDK based Mule 4 connector. However, in order to maximize customization to each customer's requirements while avoiding steep Java SDK learning curves, you can easily modify the output JSON data structure as well as connector configuration by editing 2 simple JSON schemas provided under:
>/json-logger/src/main/resources/schema/

In a nutshell, by defining the output JSON schema as well as providing some additional SDK specific details (e.g. default values, default expressions, etc.), we can dynamically generate a module that aligns to those schemas.

## Installation

Running the provided deployment script will deploy JSON Logger to your Organization's Exchange:
>e.g. ./deploy-to-exchange.sh <ANYPOINT_ORG_ID>

PS1. You can only use the _deploy.sh_ script once (unless you manually delete the previous asset from your exchange within 7 days of deployment or increase the version in the pom.xml) as you can't deploy the same version to Exchange

PS2. For EU Control Plane deployment you have to modify the `<distributionManagement>` element inide the json-logger/pom.xml in the following way:

```
<distributionManagement>
  <!-- Target Anypoint Organization Repository -->
    <repository>
      <id>Exchange2</id>
        <name>Exchange2 Repository</name>
        <url>https://maven.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1/organizations/${project.groupId}/maven</url>
        <layout>default</layout>
    </repository>
</distributionManagement>
```
